<p align="left">An agriculteur wants to allocate 150 hectares of irrigable land between the cultivation of tomatoes and peppers. He has 480 hours of labor and 440 m^3 of water available. Cultivating one hectare of tomatoes requires 1 hour of labor, 4 m^3 of water, and yields a net profit of 1000 dirhams. Cultivating one hectare of peppers requires 4 hours of labor, 2 m^3 of water, and yields a net profit of 2000 dirhams.<br><br>The irrigation office wants to protect the price of tomatoes and does not allow the agriculteur to cultivate more than 90 hectares of tomatoes. What is the best allocation of his resources ?</p>
